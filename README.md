# VIDA (Visual Insight for Developing Abilities) Login & Admin Page

This is a proof of concept for [VIDA](https://www.vidauk.org/) to create a login page for their members and also an admin page for their staff.

The idea is that users should either login or signup to become a member, before getting acces to the full site - [https://www.vidauk.org/](https://www.vidauk.org/).

The Admin page will give VIDA staff/management access to results and other data, and allowing them to send autromated emails out their members - for promotions and upcoming events.


The backend will be done using Flask MySQL (to manage the database), and the frontend will be done using Vallina JS.
